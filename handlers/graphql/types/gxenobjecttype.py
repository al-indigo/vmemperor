    Subclasses of this class get serialized w/o serialize method. Usable for complex subtypes like SoftwareVersion of GHost.
    Not usable for i.e. GVM, as GVM is not serialized by default: it is substituted by its ref and resolved later.
    GVM, GHost,etc. should be of GXenObjectType as they have their own tables which resolve them by their ref  during field resolving
